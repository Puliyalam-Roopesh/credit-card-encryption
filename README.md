# credit-card-encryption
Project Overview
Objective: Develop a secure system for encrypting and decrypting credit card information, ensuring data protection during storage and transmission.

Key Components:

Encryption & Decryption: Utilize cryptographic algorithms to protect cardholder data.

Access Control: Implement mechanisms to restrict data access to authorized users.

Cloud Integration: Leverage cloud services for scalable and secure data handling.

üß∞ Core Technologies
Cryptographic Algorithms:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A symmetric encryption algorithm ideal for encrypting data at rest.

RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman): An asymmetric encryption algorithm suitable for secure key exchanges.

Tokenization:

Replace sensitive card data with non-sensitive equivalents (tokens) to minimize exposure.

Cloud Services:

Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to store encrypted data securely and manage access controls.

üõ°Ô∏è Security and Compliance
PCI DSS Compliance: Ensure the system adheres to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which mandates encryption of cardholder data and secure access controls. 


Access Control Measures:

Authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication to verify user identities.

Authorization: Define user roles and permissions to control data access.

Audit Logging: Maintain logs of data access and system activities for monitoring and compliance.

üß™ Implementation Steps
Design the System Architecture:

Define how data flows through the system, from input to storage and retrieval.

Develop Encryption Modules:

Implement AES for encrypting card data.

Use RSA for secure key distribution.


Integrate Tokenization:
